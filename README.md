# Adventure-Game
I will make a adventure game with a decision tree. You will use mostly conditionals. You don't need any specific data and the expected outcome is dependent on whaty decision the players makes. The interesting part is that you can make it as elaborate by adding more challanges and puzzles and i will make a score systems so you know if you made the right choices to progress in the story.
